<h2>What's the project?</h2>
<p>This is a importable custom Unity package (written in c#), that changes the look of the Unity project folders tab. This works by setting a folder and drawing over the top of it with a sprite of your choice, then you can enable header settings along with if it is recursive (applies to children).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Installation guide:</h2>
<ol><li>Open the Unity project you want to import the package into.
</li></ol>
<h4>Import via git URL (requires Git):</h4>
<ol><li>Click Window &gt; Package Manager &gt; + Icon.
</li><li>Add Package from git URL.
</li><li>Copy and paste this link:
</li><li><a href="https://github.com/IAmAGameDev/CustomUnityHierarchy.git">https://github.com/IAmAGameDev/CustomUnityHierarchy.git</a></li></ol>
<h4>Import via download:</h4>
<ol><li>Download the Unity package.
</li><li>Right click in your Project View.
</li><li>Click "Import Package" &gt; "Custom Package".
</li><li>Double click the Unity Package in it's downloaded folder.</li></ol>
<h2>Why create it?</h2>
<p>This was a follow up project after making <a href="https://iamagamedev.itch.io/customunityhierarchy">CustomUnityHierarchy</a>, I wanted to make the Unity Game Engine more customised so I made this. It also taught me new editor methods and has been a fun educational project/package in which I&nbsp;can use it in all my future Unity projects.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Learning outcomes:</h2>
<ul><li>Unity Editor scripting with use of custom methods such as:<ul><li>InitializeOnLoad,
</li><li>EditorApplication.projectWindowItemOnGUI,
</li><li>GUIStyle,
</li><li>and more.</li></ul>
</li><li>UXML visual tree style sheets&nbsp;(allows changing the inspector to hide and display custom values with the Unity UI Toolkit).
</li><li>Enhanced ScriptableObject usage by learning to use&nbsp;classes to store/cache multiple data to prevent repeated checking which in turn saves&nbsp;resources.</li></ul>
